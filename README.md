# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in C++ using console input and output. The game consists of a snake that moves around the console window, eating food to grow while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

## How It Works

The game consists of three main classes:

1. **Snake**: Represents the snake in the game. It keeps track of the snake's position and provides methods for moving the snake in different directions.

2. **Food**: Represents the food that the snake needs to eat. It generates random positions for the food.

3. **Game**: Manages the game loop, user input, and game logic. It initializes the snake and food, handles user input (W, A, S, D keys for movement, and X to exit), and updates the game state based on user input and collisions.

The game runs in a console window and displays the current state of the game, including the snake, food, and the player's score.

## Usage

To play the game, compile the code and run the executable. Use the following controls:

- W: Move the snake up
- S: Move the snake down
- A: Move the snake left
- D: Move the snake right
- X: Exit the game

The goal is to eat the food and grow the snake while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.

## Possible Improvements

- Implement a high-score system to keep track of the player's best scores.
- Add more features like obstacles or power-ups to make the game more challenging.
- Enhance the graphics or user interface for a better gaming experience.
- Implement difficulty levels to control the speed of the snake.

## Possible Errors and Portability

The code includes several header files (`conio.h` and `windows.h`) that are not standard C++ headers. These headers are platform-specific and may not be available on all systems. This code may not be easily portable to different operating systems. To make the code more portable, consider using cross-platform alternatives for console input and output functions.
